        <h1>St. Louis Crime Database</h1>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Click the Download button to receive a CSV file that contains data on all crimes that occurred within the city of St. Louis dating back to January 2021.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> The raw data comes from the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, which posts monthly updates related to all crimes that occurred in St. Louis county. The database is automatically updated as new data is available, though it sometimes takes a few days for the changes to be made since the web scraper only checks the STLMPD site on a weekly basis. Check the Data Sheet for a detailed breakdown of what the CSV contains.</p>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong> I was working with a St. Louis non-profit that needed crime data within a specific geographic area within St. Louis county. Unfortunately, the crime data that is made available by STLMPD is limited: there are PDFs with monthly breakdowns by neighborhood and category (too vague to be useful for my purpose), as well as CSVs with more detailed monthly "updates". But the CSVs are a mix of new crimes committed in the current month, as well as updates/changes to cases that occurred in previous months, which is only useful if you have all the data from previous months. In order to use the data, I needed to create a database that would automatically add new crime data and update previous crimes as more information was reported. Since I felt that this was data others might find useful, I decided to make the entire database available to the public.</p>
